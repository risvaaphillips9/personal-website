          <p>Coming from Dubai to IU has been an extremely insightful journey for me because I was able to work, collaborate, and communicate with students of diverse cultures, ideas, and values.</p>
          <p>I have been able to find my passion in technology because of the support, guidance, and resources I received here at IU. The courses I have taken are very unique and I have been able to learn and refine my technical skills through them.</p>
          <p>This is one of my favorite pictures of IU, it is truly beautiful and the campus is so welcoming that I just knew this was my home away from home.</p>
          <p>Being part of the IU community has taught me to go beyond boundaries and has made me realize the importance of hardwork and time management.</p>
