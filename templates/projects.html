      <h1>Projects</h1>
      <p>
        These are the projects I have completed during the Summer 2025 Jumpstart program prior to starting my Masters Degree in Information Systems at Indiana University
        Bloomington. I have really enjoyed working on every project because I was able to gain the practical knowledge I require before stepping into the fast-paced environment of my graduate degree.

      <h2>Corporate Programs Management System</h2>
      <h3>Our Project</h3>
      <p>This project required us to demonstrate a complete understanding of the information systems development lifecycle (SDLC). Our prototype focused on building a system that manages corporate training programs offered by the university. The solution enables administrators to create courses, upload student data, auto-assign students to course sections, and generate dynamic enrollment reports, all while ensuring scalability and clean data architecture.</p>

      <h3>Big Points</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Python Console Application: Core logic for adding courses, enrolling students, and generating reports.</li>
        <li>HTML Interface: Fully navigational frontend allowing users to upload data files and view summaries.</li>
        <li>PostgreSQL Database Schema: Robust relational design supporting multiple programs, cohorts, and sections with referential integrity.</li>
        <li>Presentation Deck & Documentation: Included use case diagrams, ERD, sequence diagrams, and user stories.</li>
      </ul>
